Old and first big project written ~2004.
This tool was used by hangglider (and some paraglier) pilots to analyse their
GPS logs and find the best score possible in the french CFD challenge (see https://delta.ffvl.fr/cfd)

Project was slightly cleaned up as of 2024 to:
- support building against GTK 2.0 (instead of already dead GTK 1.2)
- remove old personnal informations
- a big reindent on everything. Uncrustify wasn't a thing back then :)
- GPS direct reading has been disabled. Project used to half build gpsbabel within its sources
  and pull the required bits. But the embedded GPS babel required completely obsolete USB libs
  and as this is clearly a legacy/memory project, I haven't taken the time to update gpsbabel to its
  latest release. (I don't even own a compatible GPS anymore).

As I said, this is my first big C project, so please don't judge me too hard on the way too
many global variables, the mismatch of naming styles, the very static memory allocations,
all the extern stuff and a whole other bunch of horrors I haven't really looked at while resurecting
the code. I started clearing up the code, but there's a lot of tuned messy and badly documented stuff
that would take me way too long to figure out for it to be worth it (I'm looking at you weird TAB macro).
